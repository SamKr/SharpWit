These classes need to be the same name as the intents you made on wit.ai.

My intents are 'Action', 'Appointment', etc, and they get casted into the corresponding class. This way, when you add a new
intent, all you have to do is make a new class.

If you add new entities, you need to define them in O_NLP.cs as well.
